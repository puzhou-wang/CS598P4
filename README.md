# MovieRecommender

This is code for a shiny app for two movie recommenders, one based on movie genre and popularity (i.e., number of reviews) and the other based on User-Based Collaborative filtering (UBCF).

I would like to thank Prof. Feng Liang for her instructions and guidance on codes. Several parts of this repo are borrowed from her [notebook](https://liangfgithub.github.io/Rcode_W13_Movie_RS.nb.html).
The shiny app is also largely modified from the scaffold of the gorgeous [BookRecommender](https://github.com/pspachtholz/BookRecommender) app build by Philipp Spachtholz.
